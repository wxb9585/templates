For the statements.py, there are several problem which could be improved. Firstly, there is a big problem on searching
the corpus. We have to go through all the word in corpus to check the verb, this will significantly slow down the process. and also
the brown corpus is not good enough. Some of the word could not be found in the corpus, such as washes, boxes and so on (actually all
the test words we used are from paper, and there are still a lot of words which can not be found). Secondly, The fact base only allow
binary and Unary fact base, we could have more kind of relationship in actually query system, and  i have tried something like this:
  $$ John and Mary are ducks.
     OK
  $$ Who is a duck?
     Eh??
  $$ Tom and Jim are ducks.
     OK.
  $$ who are ducks?
     Eh??
It seems like there is no way to add both John and Mary together at the same time for the Unary relation "duck", this is a point which
we could improve.

For pos_tagging.py, firstly we could improve unchanging plurals by increase the corpus, secondly, there is a problem about part of speech tagging
where if we write :
  $$ Tom is apple.
     OK.
  $$ John is apple.
     OK.
  $$ who is apple?
     John  Tom
we could see the tagging is wrong for apple as machine learn it as A
